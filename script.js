        description: "A spine-like robotic arm is a type of bio-inspired robotic manipulator that mimics the structure and movement of a vertebrate spine. Unlike traditional robotic arms with rigid joints and limited degrees of freedom, this design incorporates a series of interconnected flexible segments or vertebrae, allowing for smooth, continuous, and adaptive motion.Each segment is capable of bending in multiple directions, enabling the arm to move with a high degree of freedom. These arms are often driven by tendons, pneumatic actuators, or shape-memory materials, and are controlled using advanced algorithms that calculate the required bending for precise positioning. The arm behaves like a continuum—similar to an elephant’s trunk, a snake, or the human spinal column—making it ideal for navigating confined, curved, or sensitive environments.Due to their flexibility, adaptability, and compliance, spine-like robotic arms are widely used in fields such as minimally invasive surgery, search and rescue, underwater inspection, and space exploration. Their ability to handle delicate objects and operate in complex terrains makes them highly valuable in both industrial and research applications",
